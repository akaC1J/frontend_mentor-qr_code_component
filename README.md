# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my first project on Frontend Mentor.  
I repeated the basic principles of **HTML** and **CSS**, and tried to recall the main properties.  
It was a good practice to refresh my knowledge, and I will continue doing more challenges to improve my skills.

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I practiced basic layout skills and learned how to use `gap` instead of `margin`.  
I also tried the `aspect-ratio` property for images.

### Continued development
I want to continue practicing responsive design and improve my CSS skills step by step.
